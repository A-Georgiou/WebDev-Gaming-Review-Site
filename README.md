# Gaming Review Website

<h3> <u>About the Project</u> </h3>
<h5>Built using: HTML5 / CSS3 / PHP / JQuery / Bootstrap</h5>
<p>â€‹I had been learning the Bootstrap JS for a few weeks and wanted to piece together my knowledge in order to showcase to myself what I had learnt, using HTML, PHP, CSS and JQuery I designed an Aggregate Gaming Review Site that would compile reviews from different sources into one easy to filter and view website. 
It was a fun personal project that really helped piece together what seemed like abstract concepts.
From the project I learnt more about pipelining between programming languages and more about what role Java plays in Web Development.
